# Applied Data Science with Python: IMDB Software for Hollywood Actors and Actresses

## Summary

Our recent project, undertaken at Ostbayerische Technische Hochschule Regensburg, involved developing a comprehensive software application focused on Hollywood actors and actresses using data science techniques and Python. The goal was to create an intuitive platform to store, retrieve, and display detailed information on the top 50 popular actors and actresses from IMDb, including their filmography, awards, and ratings. The project was guided by Istvan Lengyel and contributed by Nguyễn Quốc Minh Thư.
